# Bunch-Projects

A collection of small projects I've created for training purposes, written in various programming languages. Larger projects might be located in other repositories.

## How to Run the Projects

To run the projects, follow these steps:

1. Download the main zip file containing all the projects.
2. Unzip the downloaded file to extract the contents.
3. Open the corresponding Chrome/HTML file for the project you wish to run.

Each project is self-contained and can be accessed directly through its respective HTML file.
